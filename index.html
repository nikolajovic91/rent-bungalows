              way. One feature of the British countryside that is mostly lost on Americans is its artificiality. It was created
              via landscaping over hundreds of years by the British people, whose thousand-year-long obsession with gardening
              is only eclipsed by their love of small cakes with raisins. In America, we're familiar with the pride suburban
              people have for their front lawn.
              <span class="read-more-target"> The difference here is momentous. American "nature preserves" are raw, unspoiled land that has looked the same
                way for eons. We preserve it precisely so it stays that way. In contrast, British "nature preserves" are
                completely spoilt by human interference dating back thousands of years. But they're preserved because they've
                reached some captivating state of in-betweenness that looks like something from a storybook.
